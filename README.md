playframework-threadpool-test
=============================

Testing the Play! Framework thread pooling.

This code complements the research I have carried out and written about on [my blog](http://liviutudor.com). The original blog post can be found here: http://liviutudor.com/2014/01/15/about-the-play-framework-and-their-thread-pooling/ and it references the code in this codebase.

The post discusses issues with `ThreadLocal` instances and the 2 types of executors under the [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.com/) : `thread-pool-executor` and `fork-join-executor`.
